# Palindrome Checker

## Overview
This Python script checks if the user-input string is a palindrome. If it is, the script acknowledges it and provides a small educational message. If not, it prompts the user to try again until a palindrome is entered.

## Features
- ✅ Takes an alphabetic string as input.
- 🔄 Reverses the string to check for palindrome.
- 🎉 Prints a fun message if the input is a palindrome.
- 🔁 Runs in a loop until a palindrome is entered.

## How It Works
1. The user is prompted to enter a string.
2. The script reverses the string and compares it with the original.
3. If they match, the script prints a congratulatory message.
4. If they don’t match, it prompts the user to try again.

## Example Output
```
Quickly add alphabetic string: madam
wow! you entered a palindrome and if you dont know what palindrome is then go and study
```

## Future Enhancements
- Add case insensitivity (so "Madam" is also detected as a palindrome).
- Allow checking phrases by ignoring spaces and punctuation.
- Improve the user experience with better messages and formatting.

Enjoy coding! 🚀
